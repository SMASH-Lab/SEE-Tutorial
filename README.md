# SEE HLA Starter Kit Lunar Rover Example

Examples for the [SEE HLA Starter Kit Framework](https://www.github.com/SMASH-Lab/SEE-HLA-Starter-Kit). Two federates are provided in this project:

* **RoverFederate**: Simulation of a single rover moving on the lunar surface that occasionally requires maintenance to be performed to continue operations.
* **RepairFederate**: A utility federate that responds to service requests from the lunar rover and carries out repairs.

The example was created using the [SEE Baseplate](https://www.github.com/SMASH-Lab/SEE-Baseplate) as the base. The same instructions for building that project and getting it up and running apply here as well.
