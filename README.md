# SEE HLA Starter Kit Lunar Rover Example

Examples for the [SEE HLA Starter Kit Framework](https://www.github.com/SMASH-Lab/SEE-HLA-Starter-Kit). Sample code of a lunar rover simulation is provided here as a tutorial.

The example was created using the [SEE Baseplate](https://www.github.com/SMASH-Lab/SEE-Baseplate) as the base. The same instructions for building that project and getting it up and running apply here as well.
